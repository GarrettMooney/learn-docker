In the Dockerfile, the `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv` is using Docker's BuildKit cache mounting feature. This creates a cached directory that persists between builds but isn't included in the final image.

When you see this line:
```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --frozen --no-dev
```

It's doing the following:
1. Creates a cache directory at `/root/.cache/uv` during the build process
2. This cache stores UV package downloads and other UV-related files
3. The cache persists between Docker builds on the same host machine (not in the container)
4. This speeds up subsequent builds by avoiding re-downloading the same packages

The actual cache lives on your Docker host machine (not in the container), typically in a location like:
- Linux: `/var/lib/docker/buildkit/`
- macOS/Windows: In the Docker desktop VM's storage

The cache is shared across builds but doesn't become part of the final image, which helps keep the image size smaller while still providing faster build times.
