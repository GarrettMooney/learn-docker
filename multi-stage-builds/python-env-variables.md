In this Dockerfile, there are two Python-specific environment variables being set:

1. `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`:
- This forces Python to run in unbuffered mode
- Output is sent straight to the terminal without being buffered
- This is useful in Docker containers because it ensures that you can see Python output in real-time in your container logs
- Without this, Python's output might be buffered and only show up in chunks, which can make debugging more difficult

2. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`:
- This prevents Python from writing .pyc files (compiled bytecode) to disk
- .pyc files are normally used to speed up module loading
- In a Docker container, these files aren't typically needed and can add unnecessary bulk to the image
- This helps keep the container size smaller and prevents potential issues with file permissions

Both of these settings are considered best practices when running Python applications in Docker containers.
