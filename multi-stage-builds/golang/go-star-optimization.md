`go mod download` downloads all the dependencies specified in the `go.mod` file and their required versions to the local Go module cache. 

In the context of this Dockerfile, it's being used as an optimization technique. By copying just the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files first and running `go mod download` before copying the rest of the source code:

1. The dependencies are downloaded and cached in a separate Docker layer
2. This layer will only be rebuilt if the `go.mod` or `go.sum` files change
3. If only the source code changes but dependencies remain the same, Docker can reuse the cached dependency layer, making builds faster

This is a common pattern in Docker builds to take advantage of layer caching and speed up subsequent builds when only application code changes but dependencies remain the same.
