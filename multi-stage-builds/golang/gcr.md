gcr.io (Google Container Registry) is Google Cloud's container image registry service. It's a place to store, manage, and secure Docker container images. It's now part of Google Cloud's Artifact Registry, which is the next generation of Container Registry.

When you see `gcr.io` in a Dockerfile, it's referencing a container image that's hosted in Google's container registry. In this specific case, `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` is referencing a "distroless" image maintained by Google that:

1. Is based on Debian 12
2. Is "distroless" (meaning it contains only your application and its runtime dependencies, but not package managers, shells, or other programs found in standard Linux distributions)
3. Runs as a non-root user (indicated by `:nonroot`)

Using gcr.io is similar to using Docker Hub (docker.io), but it's specifically Google's hosting service for container images. The format is typically:
`gcr.io/[project-id]/[image]:[tag]`

This helps create smaller, more secure containers since they contain only what's necessary to run the application.
