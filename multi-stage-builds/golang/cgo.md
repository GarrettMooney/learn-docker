CGO_ENABLED=0 disables cgo (C Go) during the Go build process. Here's what this means and why it's commonly used:

Key effects:
1. Creates a statically-linked binary that doesn't depend on external C libraries
2. Makes the resulting binary more portable since it doesn't require any external dynamic libraries
3. Generally results in a smaller container image since it doesn't need additional C runtime dependencies

Benefits:
- Better container portability
- Simpler deployment since there are no external library dependencies
- Improved security by reducing the attack surface (fewer external dependencies)

The main trade-off is that you cannot use Go packages that require cgo or C library bindings when CGO_ENABLED=0. 
However, for many Go applications, especially microservices, this is not an issue since they often don't require C library integration.

This setting is particularly useful in this Dockerfile since it's using a distroless base image (gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot), which is minimal and doesn't include many standard libraries. The statically-linked binary will run properly in this minimal environment.
