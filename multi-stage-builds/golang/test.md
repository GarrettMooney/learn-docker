The line `RUN go test -v ./...` in the Dockerfile runs all the tests in the Go project. Let's break it down:

- `go test` is the Go command to run tests
- `-v` flag enables verbose output, showing all tests that are run and their results
- `./...` is a pattern that tells Go to recursively run tests in the current directory and all subdirectories

This command will run all test files (files ending in `_test.go`) throughout the entire project and report whether they pass or fail. The verbose flag (-v) means you'll see detailed output for each test, which is useful for debugging if any tests fail during the container build process.

This line is part of a dedicated test stage in the multi-stage Dockerfile, which helps ensure that the code passes all tests during the build process.
