The `--no-install-recommends` flag in `apt-get install` tells the package manager (APT) to install only the main packages that were explicitly requested and their required dependencies, while skipping the recommended and suggested packages.

In Debian/Ubuntu systems, packages can have:
1. Required dependencies (must be installed)
2. Recommended packages (should be installed, but not mandatory)
3. Suggested packages (optional extras)

By using `--no-install-recommends`, you:
- Reduce the image size by not installing unnecessary packages
- Install only what is strictly needed for the application to run
- Create more minimal and efficient Docker images

This is considered a best practice when building Docker images because it helps keep the container images as small as possible while still maintaining full functionality.

In the Dockerfile shown, it's used when installing `libgl1` and `libglib2.0-0` in the base image, and `build-essential` in the build stage, ensuring only the essential components are installed.
